Reimplement hangman.

Limitations/differences from before:

-No loops are allowed except for the main game loop, which is a single while loop. All looping must be subsumed through map, filter, and reduce.

-The art for hangman should be read from a file, this art connotates the state of the game.

-The user should be able to enter their name, where their name and score will be recorded to a file after each game.X

-The game will tell the user if they have the high score or not.

- no exceptions are allowed, all exceptions must be caught by the program./

Questions for this assignment
Can map, filter, and reduce really fit all my needs for this game?
